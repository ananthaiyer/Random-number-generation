# Random-number-generation
Implement a Linear Congruential Random Number Generator (RNG), explore its behavior for different parameter values of mm, and simulate one pseudo-random sample.
Derive a method to sample from the exponential distribution using uniform random variables, write an R function for the sampling process, and evaluate the quality using qq-plots for different values of λλ.
Design an acceptance-rejection approach to sample from a beta distribution, identifying an appropriate proposal distribution to minimize rejection rates.
Extend the beta distribution sampling method to support user-specified parameters, ensuring functionality for cases where parameters exceed 1.
